# Nexa

**Nexa** is a modern modular front-end and SCSS framework designed for building fast, adaptive, and maintainable web interfaces.

## Key Features

-   🧩 **Modular architecture** — organized SCSS structure with configurable maps, mixins, and variables.
-   🎨 **Design system ready** — includes color schemes, typography, grid, spacers, and rounded element control.
-   ⚡ **Utility-based approach** — generates helper classes for spacing, flex, grid, width/height, and visibility.
-   🧠 **Adaptive mixins** — built-in media query helpers like `adaptive()` and `adaptive-above()`.
-   🪄 **Dynamic components** — styled UI elements such as buttons, forms, modals, tables, checkboxes, and switches.
-   🧱 **SCSS maps configuration** — every component and variable is controlled via central `_settings.scss`.

## Goal

To provide a **clean, customizable SCSS framework** that bridges design consistency and developer flexibility for modern web projects.
